# ELEC 498 Capstone - LiteLM

## Project Overview
**LiteLM** is an FPGA-based hardware accelerator designed to efficiently run inference for Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). The project aims to offload compute-intensive operations—such as Matrix Multiplications (GEMM) and Attention mechanisms—from general-purpose processors to specialized hardware logic, enabling faster and more energy-efficient inference on edge devices.

## Architecture
The accelerator is built around a custom High-Level Synthesis (HLS) design that processes the Transformer model layer-by-layer.

## Directory Structure

*   **`Model-architectures/<arch>/HLS-Verilog/`**: Core HLS source code for a given hardware architecture (e.g. Phi-3, GPT-2).
    *   Current Phi-3 baseline: `Model-architectures/phi3-mini-int4-HARDWARE/HLS-Verilog/`
    *   `Scheduler_FSM/`: The main control logic and Finite State Machine.
    *   `ControlMemInterface/`: Interface for control memory.
    *   `IRQ_Wizard/`: Interrupt handling logic.
    *   `top.cpp`: The top-level wrapper for the HLS design.
*   **`SV_testbenches/`**: SystemVerilog testbenches for low-level hardware verification (e.g., `run_head_group_tb.sv`).
*   **`vitis_simulations/`**: Vitis-based simulation files.
*   **`vivado_simulations/`**: Vivado-based simulation files.

### Prerequisites
*   Xilinx Vitis / Vivado (2024.1 or compatible)

### Simulation
Refer to `Model-architectures/phi3-mini-int4-HARDWARE/HLS-Verilog/README.md` for details on running C-simulations for individual modules.
